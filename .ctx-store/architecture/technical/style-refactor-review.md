# SkillVo Style Refactoring Review Checklist

This document provides a structured review process for each phase of the styles refactoring plan. Use these checklists to verify the quality, consistency, and completeness of each phase before proceeding to the next.

## Phase 1 Review: Base Control Optimization

### Base Control Class Review
- [ ] All properties use design tokens from `styles/abstracts/variables/`
- [ ] No hardcoded values for colors, spacing, typography, etc.
- [ ] Clear structure with organized comments by section (box model, typography, etc.)
- [ ] No duplicated properties or redundant styles
- [ ] Base class size is reduced by at least 30% from original

### Mixins Organization
- [ ] All state mixins moved to `_state-mixins.scss`
- [ ] All layout mixins moved to `_layout-mixins.scss`
- [ ] All responsive mixins moved to `_responsive-mixins.scss`
- [ ] All typography mixins moved to `_typography-mixins.scss`
- [ ] All accessibility mixins moved to `_accessibility-mixins.scss`
- [ ] Each mixin file has proper documentation header and inline comments
- [ ] Each mixin has a clear, single responsibility

### Non-Core Functionality Extraction
- [ ] Animations moved to `_animations.scss`
- [ ] Print styles moved to a dedicated utility file
- [ ] High contrast mode handling moved to accessibility utilities
- [ ] RTL support properly handled/extracted

### Utils Directory Structure
- [ ] `_index.scss` forwards all mixin files
- [ ] Mixins properly categorized by function
- [ ] No duplication between old and new mixin files
- [ ] File naming is consistent and follows naming conventions

### Documentation
- [ ] Base control interface is documented
- [ ] Extension points are clearly defined
- [ ] State handling is documented
- [ ] Boundaries between base and category levels are defined

## Phase 2 Review: Category Base Classes Refinement

### For Each Category Base Class
- [ ] Extends base control properly
- [ ] No duplicate properties from base control
- [ ] All values use design tokens
- [ ] Clear structure with organized comments
- [ ] Extension points documented
- [ ] States handling properly inherited
- [ ] Category-specific styles are isolated
- [ ] Common behavior for the category properly defined
- [ ] No component-specific properties

### Action Controls
- [ ] Consistent button-like interaction model
- [ ] Proper focus state handling
- [ ] Appropriate padding and spacing
- [ ] Clear active states

### Selection Controls
- [ ] Consistent checked/selected state
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for state changes
- [ ] Proper disabled state handling
- [ ] Consistent spacing for selection indicators

### Input Controls
- [ ] Consistent input appearance
- [ ] Proper focus and input states
- [ ] Validation state handling
- [ ] Placeholder styling

### Navigation Controls
- [ ] Consistent navigation patterns
- [ ] Active/current state handling
- [ ] Proper focus state for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Mobile-friendly tap targets

### Feedback Controls
- [ ] Consistent alert/notification styling
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy for different severity levels
- [ ] Proper use of color for status indication
- [ ] Accessible color contrast for all states

### Information/Data Display
- [ ] Consistent layout patterns
- [ ] Proper spacing and alignment
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy for data presentation
- [ ] Responsive behavior

## Phase 3 Review: Component Implementation Cleanup

### For Each Component
- [ ] Properly extends category base class
- [ ] No duplicate properties from category base
- [ ] All values use design tokens
- [ ] Variants properly implemented (primary, secondary, etc.)
- [ ] Component-specific states clearly defined
- [ ] Animations/transitions are consistent
- [ ] Responsive behavior is properly handled

### Visual Design
- [ ] Visual styling matches design specifications
- [ ] Consistent shadows, borders, and radiuses
- [ ] Proper spacing between and within components
- [ ] Color usage follows color system guidelines

### State Management
- [ ] Hover, focus, active states work as expected
- [ ] Disabled and readonly states properly styled
- [ ] Interactive states accessible via keyboard
- [ ] Error, success, and other validation states clear

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Component functions correctly in all expected use cases
- [ ] Variants support intended functionality
- [ ] Size variations maintain proper touch targets
- [ ] Component-specific features fully implemented

## Phase 4 Review: Angular Component Integration

### Angular Component Pattern
- [ ] Component correctly imports SCSS
- [ ] Host element styling is appropriate
- [ ] Content projection properly styled
- [ ] Angular-specific customizations minimal
- [ ] SCSS properly scoped to component

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Visual regression tests in place
- [ ] Component renders correctly in all targeted browsers
- [ ] Accessibility testing passes
- [ ] Theme switching works (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Responsive testing complete

### Documentation
- [ ] Component usage documented
- [ ] Props/inputs documented
- [ ] Events/outputs documented
- [ ] Examples included for common use cases
- [ ] Customization options explained

### Best Practices
- [ ] OnPush change detection used
- [ ] Unnecessary re-renders prevented
- [ ] Input/Output naming consistent with Angular guidelines
- [ ] Proper encapsulation of styles
- [ ] Classes follow naming conventions

## Final Refactoring Review

- [ ] High contrast mode supported
- [ ] Reduced motion preferences respected
- [ ] Screen reader testing passes
