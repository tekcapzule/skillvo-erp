## What Works
- Memory Bank documentation has been created with most of the required files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - activeContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
- Theming system:
  - Light and dark theme implementation complete
  - CSS custom properties used for all theme variables
  - Semantic tokens for consistent application of styles
  - Theme switching via data-theme attribute
  - System preference detection and user preference saving
  - Color palettes optimized for accessibility and contrast
  - Responsive transitions between themes

## What's In Progress
- Initial project setup and configuration
- Creating the basic structure for the Angular monorepo
- Setting up the shell application and feature modules
- Application of theme styles across all components

## What's Left to Build
- Complete implementation of all feature modules (Learn, Hire, Onboard, Settings)
- UI components library
- Data access layer and API integration
- Authentication with AWS Cognito
- Multi-tenant support and white-labeling
- Internationalization support

## Current Status
- Project is in initial setup phase
- Documentation and planning phase is mostly complete
- Theming system is implemented and refined for production use
- Next step is to continue implementation of the core shell application and structure

## Current Priorities
1. Apply themed styles across all UI components
2. Set up complete Nx workspace structure
3. Implement Shell application with routing
