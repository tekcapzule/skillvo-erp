# Application Module Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines how to implement the application module for SkillVo ERP APIs. The application module orchestrates domain logic, implements domain services, and coordinates business operations following Pragmatic DDD principles.

## Components

### Service Implementations

- Concrete implementations of domain service interfaces
- Orchestrate business flows across multiple aggregates
- Handle transactional boundaries
- No direct UI or infrastructure dependencies

### Command Handlers

- Process specific commands to modify system state
- Single responsibility per handler
- Validate input before processing
- Coordinate with repositories and domain services
- Emit domain events after state changes

### Query Handlers

- Process read operations
- Convert domain objects to appropriate response formats
- Optimize for read scenarios
- No domain state modifications

### Mappers

- Transform data between domain objects and DTOs
- Maintain clean separation between layers
- Centralize conversion logic

## Implementation Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have one clear purpose
2. **Use Case Driven**: Organize code around business use cases
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on domain interfaces, not implementations
6. **Validation**: Validate inputs before domain operations

## CQRS Pattern Usage

The application module implements the Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern:

- Commands: Change state but return no data
- Queries: Return data but don't change state

This separation improves performance, scalability, and code organization.

## Error Handling

- Convert domain exceptions to appropriate application exceptions
- Add context information to errors
- Maintain audit trail for operations

## Example Reference

Refer to the course service application module for implementation patterns. Key aspects to note:

- Command handler implementation style
- Service orchestration patterns
- Transaction boundary management
- Error handling strategies

The application module serves as the coordination layer between the domain core and the external interfaces and infrastructure.
