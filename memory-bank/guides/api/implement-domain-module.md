# Domain Module Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines how to implement the domain module for SkillVo ERP APIs. The domain module is the core of your service, containing pure business logic with no external dependencies.

## Structure

```
service-name/domain/
├── src/main/java/com/skillvo/service/
│   ├── model/             # Aggregate roots, entities, value objects
│   ├── event/             # Domain events
│   ├── exception/         # Domain-specific exceptions
│   ├── repository/        # Repository interfaces
│   └── service/           # Domain service interfaces
└── src/test/java/com/skillvo/service/
    └── model/             # Unit tests for domain models
```

## Components

### Aggregate Roots

- Define aggregate roots as the main entry points to your domain
- Each aggregate root has a unique identity
- Make it a POJO and no methods and logic.

### Entities

- Objects with an identity that persists over time
- Defined by their identity rather than attributes
- Make it a POJO and no methods and logic.

### Value Objects

- Immutable objects defined by their attributes
- No identity concept
- Used to encapsulate and validate domain concepts
- Should be treated as whole units

### Repository Interfaces

- Define methods for aggregate persistence
- Include only the contract, not the implementation

### Domain Service Interfaces

- No implementation details, just the contract


## Implementation Principles

1. **No External Dependencies**: Domain should not depend on frameworks, databases, or UI
2. **Immutable Where Possible**: Especially for value objects
3. **Domain Language**: Use ubiquitous language throughout

## Example Reference

Refer to the course service domain module for implementation patterns. Key aspects to note:

- How aggregate roots maintain consistency
- Value object validation approach
- Entity relationship management
- Repository interface design
- Domain service interface design

Remember, the domain module should contain only interfaces for repositories and services, with no implementation details.
